# Ultra amazing game 

## Requirements 
* [ ] **Don't get Beta-d**
* [ ] **Strong** character model made by us in Blender
* [ ] Character moves (using matrices) around with input mechanism (maybe with PS4 controller)
* [ ] Two different viewpoints and switching (3rd person and FPS)
* [ ] Cutscene, with moving camera. Camera animated with Bezier curve stuff
* [ ] Environment, at least one 3D model of our creation in Blender. ADD MORE STUFF (skyboxes??)
* [ ] Shading: At least Blinn-Phong Shading model / Advanced materials welcome
* [ ] Character should have special powers (to get stronger):
  * [ ] Character should change the shape
  * [ ] Shading should turn to X-Toon-Shading model (either on one object or overall).
  * [ ] The second axis of the X-toon needs to signal something
* [ ] Textures: We need them. Also for material params
  * [ ] Normal map
  * [ ] Shininess map 
  * [ ] Bump map ??? - more research 
* [ ] Illumination: 
  * [ ] Include light sources
  * [ ] Apply shadow mapping
  * [ ] To filtering on the shadow map
  * [ ] Special light with falloff inside a cone (spotlight-batsignal)
  * [ ] Integrate a mechanism to determine whether a player is receibing light from this cone
* [ ] Transperancy: Add transparency effects use the peeling strategy to sort 
* [ ] Animation: Main character and others should rely on skinning, tha game should include at least on thing with several animated components. At least 4 hierarchy levels.
  * **Question:** Do we need to code the skinning?
* [ ] Paths: At least one feature of the game should make use of smooth paths using Bezier curves. 
  * [ ] At least one cubic but let's do concatetanation
* [ ] Window resizing
* [ ] Bonuses
  * [ ] Normal mapping 
  * [ ] Particle effects
  * [ ] Collisions
